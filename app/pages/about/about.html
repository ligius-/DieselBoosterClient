  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This app is a work-in progress designed to work with accompanying Arduino/Bluetooth module inside the car.
  </p>
  <p>
    The analog signal from the high pressure fuel pump is altered by introducing a configurable offset yielding higher
    power and/or better fuel consumption.<BR>
    Tune the values slowly and check all scenarios (especially both heavy acceleration and idle with no load).<BR>
    <BR>
  </p>

  <h3>Calibration:</h3>
  <p>
    Start with <b>Global Gain</b> (between 90-100) and <b>Global Offset</b> (between 110-140) until the values with the
    module off match the ones with the module on.<BR>
    The goal is to match the 'Output to ECU' value (i2) with the module <i>disabled</i> with the 'Sensor input value'
    (i1) with the module <i>enabled</i>.<BR>
    The gain value will alter the slope - i.e. if the calibrated values will get progressively apart/closer as you range
    the engine RPM then you need to decrease/increase the gain.<BR>
    The offset will alter the difference between the two - if the calibrated values are apart from the real ones with a
    constant amount (regardless of RPM) you can compensate for that.<BR>
    <BR>
  </p>
  <h3>Precautions:</h3>
  <p>
    Once you have found the values that closely match the factory ones (with the module enabled) write them down and
    also save them as the default ones.<BR>
    Leave the module disabled by <i>default</i> until you fully understand its effects.<br>
    If you receive any errors/dashboard dings, stop the engine immediately (but safely) and either disable the module or
    load the safe defaults.<BR>
    If you don't remember the safe defaults, you can <b>use Gain=100, Offset=128 as acceptable defaults</b> and all curve gain points at 100%.
    With the engine off the original sensor value is ~100 (0.5V), at idle is ~200 (1V), acceptable maximum is 1024 (5V)<BR>
    <BR>
  </p>
  <h3>Tuning:</h3>
  <p>
    This should be done only after the calibration phase is performed, otherwise the results are meaningless.<BR>
    Also, the conditions would have to be similar (same engine temeperature, same outside temperature, same stretch of road) because the changes might be small.<BR>
    <BR>
    The easiest way is to alter the global offset. Generally, going to a higher value decreases fuel consumption.<BR>
    <BR>
    A better tuning however is to use the curve points, these 15 points specify an increase (or decrease) for a specific RPM band.<BR>
    In this scenario, the previous offset and gain values still apply, but now there is a specific gain (in percentage) to the sensor value, only if the value is between <i>minRange</i> and <i>maxRange</i>.<BR>
    So a sensible min/max range would be 200 (=0.97V) to 750 (=3.66V). This means that there are now 15 tuning bands between those two numbers: 200-236, 237-273, 274-310, ... 713-750.<BR>
    <BR>
    Within each band the gain can be adjusted while the engine sensor is during that range. The adjustment value starts at 100% (original) and can be changed from 1% to 255%.<BR>
    <b>Example:</b> if setting the <i>second</i> the curve point to 115% all the values within 237 and 273 will be multiplied by 1.15.<br>
    If curve point 15(-1) is set to 75%, all values within 713 and 750 will be multiplied by 0.75.<BR>
    The curve points should be evenly spaced in values i.e. big jumps in gains should be avoided and performed only gradually.<BR>
    <BR>
    Probably any setting below 70% or above 130% does not make a lot of sense - unless for specific reasons like throttling - and should be avoided.<BR>

  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  <p>
    <b>Is this going to damage my car?</b><BR>
    Likely not, but it might trigger errors and cause the car to work in 'limp mode' until the error is erased.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Will my engine explode?</b><BR>
    Probably not, the car is still working mostly within factory limits. The ECU is designed to handle all possible
    values coming from the overriden sensor.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>I got an error in the dashboard.</b><BR>
    If possible, stop the car immediately, stop the engine. You might want to wait 1 minute until you start the engine
    again.<BR>
    If the module is starting with the DEFAULT_ON switch set to on and you've overridden the default settings with some
    erroneous ones, set the switch to OFF and use the app to change to some sensible settings before.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>I got an error in the dashboard. Doesn't go away with engine restart.</b><BR>
    You need an OBD2 adapter (Bluetooth or USB) and the software to reset it. There are some devices that read and reset
    the errors.<BR>
    Example: Android phone/tablet, ELM327 BT adapter, Torque software - this combination is able to erase the error.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Will I lose my warranty?</b><BR>
    Possibly, but unlikely. If you perform the modifications in a reversible way and no errors are recorded the service
    has no way of knowing that anything was altered.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>I don't know what all the settings do.</b><BR>
    Neither do I, but there is a helpful hint icon that you can press to get additional information.
